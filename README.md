iOS application in xamarin forms



## Getting started

I've changed two files for an evident purpose. You have to configure your API services.
This project uses a web server with:
* laravel
* redis
* node js
Anyway you can use whatever you want in the web application even if you change something there won't be problem
with this mobile version.
